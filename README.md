# Rock Paper Scissors Game

A simple yet fun **console-based Python project** that lets users play the classic **Rock Paper Scissors** game against the computer.  
This project demonstrates the use of **Python basics**, including randomization, user input handling, and conditional logic.

##  Project Overview

The **Rock Paper Scissors Game** allows a user to choose between **rock**, **paper**, or **scissors**, while the computer randomly selects one of the three options.  
The game logic then determines the winner based on traditional rules:

-  Rock beats Scissors  
-  Scissors beat Paper  
-  Paper beats Rock  

The program continues until the user decides to stop playing.

##  Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python 3  
- **Modules Used:** `random` (for computer choice generation)  
- **Platform:** Console / Command-line Interface

##  Concepts Applied

This project implements several key **Python programming concepts**:

1. **Random Module:**  
   Generates the computer’s choice randomly using `random.choice()`.

2. **Conditional Statements:**  
   Used to determine the winner between the player and computer.

3. **Loops:**  
   The `while` loop allows repeated gameplay until the user decides to exit.

4. **Functions:**  
   Code is organized within a function `play()` to enhance modularity.

5. **User Input Handling:**  
   The `input()` function collects and processes the user’s choice effectively.
